It's simply the @Class@ function along with its utilitaries to create classes as we love to do with Prototype.js, except it doesn't come with the rest of the library.

It's a fun little "Prototypal" functional library you're gonna love, if you liked to use @Class.create@ along @jQuery@ but couldn't tolerate to use two complete semi-redondant libraries.

Enjoy!
